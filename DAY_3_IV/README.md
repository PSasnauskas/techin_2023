# Day 3. Home Practice

### Home task is to create additional Controller with supporting functionality to operate the **Room** entity.

## Things to implement:
- [ ] Controller
- [ ] Service (it's responsibility: manage entity, mostly leveraging Repository for now)
- [ ] Repository
- [ ] Mapper

### Additional comments
Invent Your own fields for **Room** entity.
Don't create validation yet. We'll work on it later.
Don't work on any Unit/Integration tests. We'll work on it later.
Try the behaviour out via Swagger. It will be available at `http://localhost:8080/swagger...`
